1.) Test clousure Activity:
					After executing the test cases we need to prepare
					
					1. Test Report
					2. Bug Report
					3. Test Configuration
					4. Test Metrics
					5. RTM(Requirement Traceability Matrix)
					
2.) HTTP
		 . Hypertext Transfer Protocol
		 . Insecured
	     . No Encryption
		 . No certification needed
	HTTPS
		 . Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secured
		 . Secured
		 . Encryption
		 . certification needed
		 
3.) Defect : Problem in the application identified & reported by developer
	
	Bug : Problem in the application identified & reported by testing team

	Error (or) Failure : Problem in the application identified & reported by client

4.) Bug : After executing the test cases 
			if the expected result is not matching with actual result
			then the status became fail & then it is a bug
			
			
5.) Test suite
				It is a group of test cases
				
6.) How will you Estimate a feature ?
					After analyazing the requirements based on the complexity of the requirements
					
7.) End to End Testing (E to E testing)
						Testing the end to end functionality and non functionality of the application 
						
						It includes software ,hardware,network,database,input output devices , servers & tools etc
						
						
8.) Test script
			
			. Test steps in manual testing
			. It is short program to test the functionality in automation testing
			
9.) Latent Bug
				Bug which has been in the application for long time but it is identified now
				
				. Fuzzy Testing(Negative testing)
				. Random Testing(Adhoc testing)
				
				
10.)	7 principles of software testing
		  . Testing shows presence of defects
		  . Exhaustive testing is not possible
		  . Early testing
		  . Defect clustering
		  . pesticide paradox
		  . Testing is context dependent
		  . Absence of error fallacy
